'''1-  A Dictionary is a one of the part of data structure and represented as a 
       pair in form of "KEY" and its "VALUE"
   2-  Dictionary is stored in Curly Brackets {}
   3-  To create an Empty dictionary the syntax we use {} for its key and its value
       EXAMPLE- {1:Akash,1:Amit}
   4-  To create an Empty dictionary the syntax is []
       hashmap[nums[i]]=i --> here it is storing key and value while iterating one by
       one through loop
   5-  Every key Will be separated from its value using COLON(:) in a dictionary
   6-  Also, we can convert the sequence of key value into a dictionary
       for example->dict([(1,Akash),(2,Amit)])
   
   '''
Text= dict([(1,'Akash'),(2,'Amit')])
print('Dictionary in the form of key and its values->',Text)
